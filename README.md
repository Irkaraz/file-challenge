File Challenge
</h1>

- You must read and process two files.
- The files refer to fictitious operations on the stock exchange.
- The expected result is a calculation made using both files.
- The Operations file contains in each line a purchase or sale operation, the start date of the operation and the date of sale. As well as other data such as the name of the action (NM_SUBPRODUTO), manager and other data.
- The MercadoData file contains the price according to the number of days in which an operation occurred.
- The expected result is the grouping by action of calculating the final value operated and returning it in a CSV file with the headers: SubProduct and Result.
- To find the value of a single operation you must do quantity * price.
